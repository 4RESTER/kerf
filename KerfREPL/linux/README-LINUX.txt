Because of shared libeditline incompatibilities between the various Linux distros, there are currently two Linux binary releases of Kerf: pick the Debian one if you use "apt-get" and the Fedora one if you use "yum". If neither works let me know.

In the future I expect we will unify the two releases by statically including the libedit library.
